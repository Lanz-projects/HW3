				<h2>History and Culture</h2>
				<p>
					Japan's history spans thousands of years, beginning with its earliest known inhabitants, the Jomon people, around 14,000 BCE. Over time, Japan developed a distinct culture, influenced by neighboring China and Korea, especially in writing, Buddhism, and governmental structures. 
					The country's feudal era (12th-19th centuries) was marked by the rule of samurai warriors and powerful shoguns, with the Emperor serving largely as a figurehead. During the Edo period (1603-1868), Japan experienced over two centuries of peace and isolation, preserving its traditions while limiting foreign influence. 
					This isolation ended abruptly with the Meiji Restoration in 1868, when Japan modernized rapidly, adopting Western technology and becoming a global power. In the 20th century, Japan's involvement in World War II and its subsequent defeat led to a period of reconstruction, and today it stands as a major economic and technological power while still embracing its cultural heritage.
